##Setup
To use racman, follow these steps:
### PS3 setup
First, make sure you have `webMAN MOD` installed on a jailbroken PS3 using either a console with custom firmware or a HEN-enabled console.
It's important that you have the full version of webMAN MOD, which can be done by holding L1 while running the installer.

Make sure your PC and PS3 are connected to the same network.
Then, to connect racman to your PS3, you need to IP address from your PS3. This can be done by going into Settings > System Settings > System Information on your console.
Input the IP address and insert it into the racman.exe application on your PC.
Then all you need to do is run a game, and click Attach!

### RPCS3 setup
Just run `racman.exe`, then while your game is open in RPCS3, click the `RPCS3` button.
Some features such as patch loading, or other features that may edit the game's code (such as fast loads, autosplitter patches etc.) are unfortunately not supported on RPCS3.
