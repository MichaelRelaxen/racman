## Tips for Future Contributors

If you're interested in contributing to this project, here are some helpful tips:

- **RacTrainer Folder**: Inside the RacTrainer folder, you'll find subfolders for each game. Each of these subfolders contains essential form files that create the user interface (UI).

- **Offset Folder**: In the offset folder, there is also a subfolder for each game. However, in this case, the goal of these files is to modify the game's behavior. Each of these subfolders contains a main class that handles interactions with the game and includes a list of memory addresses that can be read and modified.
