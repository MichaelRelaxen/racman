## RaC2 by robo
- New version of the autosplitter with many improvements
    - Fix issue with double or triple splitting when going to planets by means other than the ship
    - "Split on protopet" option now splits at the correct time and is enabled by default 
    - New split route option using LiveSplit split names
        - Splits only when the next planet matches your upcoming split name
        - Planet names configurable via `rac2planets.txt`
